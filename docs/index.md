Cl√© is a C-like programming language compiled to optimized native code.
As a hobby/learning project of [@polsys](https://github.com/polsys), it is purposefully feature-poor, but at the same time aims to avoid typical footguns of the C world.
If you know C#, you will be immediately familiar; the language is also inspired by Rust.
