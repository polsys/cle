Cl√© is a C-like programming language compiled to optimized native code.
As a hobby/learning project of [@polsys](https://github.com/polsys), it is purposefully feature-poor, but at the same time aims to avoid typical footguns of the C world.
If you know C#, you will be immediately familiar; the language is also inspired by Rust.


## Language specification
This is an almost rigorous reference for the language.

* [The design philosophy](language-spec/design-philosophy.md)
* Compilation and modules
* Types
* Statements
* Expressions
* Attributes

More documentation is to be added later.
